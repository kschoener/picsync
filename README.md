# picsync
## UB Hacking 2016: The goal of this project is to sync photos with the beat of a song.

## Directions:
- If you don't have pydub installed, I have the zip for you to install
```
$ python3 picsync.py path/to/dir/of/pictures path/to/song.mp3
```
- And your video outputs to the directory you are currently in
