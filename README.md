# picsync
## UB Hacking 2016: The goal of this project is to sync photos with the beat of a song.

## Directions:
- If you don't have pydub installed, I have the zip for you to install
```
$ python3 picsync.py path/to/dir/of/pictures path/to/song.mp3
```
- And your video outputs to the directory you are currently in
- You can dive into the code to choose either a fast output with a huge file size
- Or a slow output with a miniscule file size

** this program requires a folder of images and a single mp3 file

** all images must be the same dimensions
